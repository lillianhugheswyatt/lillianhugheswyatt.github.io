title: About me
---
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech, where I am studying materials for superconducting quantum electronics in the groups of Prof. Austin Minnich and Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini. In Septemeber 2025 I completed my Ph.D. in Materials at the University of California Santa Barbara, under the supervision of Prof. Ania Bleszynki Jayich and Prof. Kunal Mukherjee (Stanford). My Ph.D. research focused on creating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition growth. My dissertation, entitled, "Engineering interacting spin systems in diamond for quantum technologies," can be found [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4dj7h688).
